yes it seems Old man winter paid us a visit late last night.
and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet , but a blanket a blanket of snow.
Yes from jellyfish fields to residential abodes , to bustling downtown.
It’s nothing but the white stuff.
And local resident are taking notice.
What’s this
Drop of rain frozen into ice crystals
I shall harness their energy and rule the world
Stop, I wish to rule you
